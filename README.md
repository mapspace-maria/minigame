# minigame
easiest mini game in the world


In this HTML file, we have a canvas element with an ID of "gameCanvas". We also include a stylesheet to add a border around the canvas element. Finally, we include a script tag to load our game's JavaScript file.

(see html file)

This code adds a bouncing effect to the red rectangle by changing its position on the canvas every time draw() is called. The x and y variables keep track of the position of the rectangle, while speedX and speedY control how fast it moves in each direction. The if statements check if the rectangle has hit the canvas walls and reverse its direction if so. You can adjust the speedX and speedY variables to change how fast the rectangle moves.
